        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8A77E2">Hello,
            my name is Mike and I'm TieRack's developer.&nbsp; I write and
            customize a small software package for the electronic component
            industry, and I originally built TieRack for my own use, to assist
            me while installing my software, training users, and providing
            support.&nbsp; Geographically, my closest customer is several states
            away so all of the setup, service, training, and support work that I
            do has to be done remotely.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8A77E2">For each new
            installation of my product, I needed complete and reliable remote
            access to the application server in my customers' office, and
            usually a few of the desktops as well for training and other tasks.&nbsp; The majority of my customers, however, lacked the
            technical know-how to open their corporate network for standard VNC
            or pcAnywhere access, or were understandably hesitant to do so,
            fearing that it might permit unauthorized access along with my own.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8A77E2">The remote connection
            aspect became the most troublesome part of the entire process, and
            in several cases I lost excellent sales opportunities simply because
            the prospective customer wasn't able to successfully configure their
            firewall for the access I needed to get them up and running.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8A77E2">The solution I came
            up with, the one that completely dissolved the problem and the one
            that I've been using ever since, is TieRack.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8A77E2">TieRack allows system administrators
                  and support technicians immediate, secure, and reliable access
                  to an array of configured client workstations.&nbsp; Installed
                  clients maintain persistent connections to TieRack, and allow
                  rack managers full access and control regardless of location,
                  network configuration, or intermittent connectivity.&nbsp; The
            connections are initiated from within the client's network, so no
            configuration changes or security compromises need to be made.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8A77E2">Below is a list of
            the things that TieRack has to offer.&nbsp; Give it a try, and <a href="mailto:mike@newmethodsoftware.com">let
            me know what you think</a>.&nbsp; I hope you find it remotely useful
            :)</font></p>

                  feature to initiate remote VNC access regardless of the client
                  machine's location or firewall configuration.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" color="#8A77E2" size="2">This single
                  feature revolutionized the way I was able to provide
                  installation, configuration, and troubleshooting
                  services.&nbsp; Instead of having to ask my customers'
                  technical staffs to forward ports, they simply install a
                  TiePin, enter the connection details I send, and the machines
                  I need are immediately available for VNC access.</font></td>

                  Query results can be viewed immediately, stored for transfer,
                  and exported to one of several file formats ( currently .csv,
                  .xls, and .txt).&nbsp; Local files can be transferred and
                  imported as tables, and any data set can be viewed and
                  manipulated with several powerful tools for filtering,
                  transforming, and organizing the data itself.</font>

                  saw the benefit in developing a method to streamline the

                  import it to a holding database, filter and organize it, and
